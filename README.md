  This is a little program which can check whether a WFF is valid. If so,it 
will print the truth table and calculate the main DNF and CNF.
  I wrote this to practice what I have learned in Professor ChenJianming's Discrete 
Mathematics and also to check my C++ programming skills.
  I am sure there must be planty of mistakes or bugs in my code, so please do
let me know it if you kindly test my program and find something wrong! Thank 
you! ^_^
